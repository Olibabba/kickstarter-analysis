## Findings
### Success of Kickstarters for Theatre and Plays Specifically
As you can see from the charts below, we have reason to be optimistic based solely on the fact that theatre kickstarters, and plays specifically are more successful than any other type of fundraiser.

 Of course the sheer number of theatre fundraisers is above all other categories, and plays specifically dwarf all other theatre subcategories. So let's look closer a those individually.

 ### Success Based on Launch Date
 As counter-intuitive as it may seem, there are better months to launch your capmaign, and some months to avoid launching. As can been seen below, avoid winter campaigns, especially December. But starting in May, or even June or July his highly recommended.

 ### Goal vs Amount Pledged
 Looking at the chart below we can optimize your fundraising goal and greatly increase it's chaances of success.

 It's clear that a modest goal is more likely to be met. With even the median goal of $4000 surpassing the higher pledged amounts by about $1000. I would recommend a stretchgoal of $2000 in order to fulfill your vision while also remaining comfartably within the range of what is typically pledged.
